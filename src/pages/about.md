# Who the heck actually am I?

> _To keep it very short I am an eighteen-year old youngster immigrated to the UK, pursuing Bachelor’s in CS and looking for an opportunity in tech – that’s who I am._

## A little back

Around 5 years ago, I started living. Sounds strange, right? Keep reading and I will tell you my story. (This page’s content is **to be updated regularly** in the next couple of weeks, so consider checking back in a while).

## Tech that I live with

Currently living the best of my life with **JS** and **React**, however there is some more:

- Python, Numpy, Pandas, Django, DRF
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, Mongo
- Swift, C, Java - still discovering the edges
- TailwindCSS, NextJS, Express
- AWS, Docker, DigitalOcean (frequent user)
- Postman, Notion

## Experience

I started my journey in summer 2020 with [KhanAcademy.org](https://KhanAcademy.org) particularly with JavaScript course. Although nothing was clear by that time, I am very grateful to [Tehnikum.school](https://Tehnikum.school) for taking me into the world of software. In late 2020, I took a Python course. This was the start.

Today, I have developed and deployed 20+ automated commercial Telegram bots for companies.
